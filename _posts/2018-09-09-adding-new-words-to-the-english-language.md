# Adding new words to the English language
[Tweet your love for collabrency][0]
![Jagnoor's article about adding new words to the english dictionary](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4917be55-c808-47a1-90d6-cab271718f8f.jpg)

Last year we decided to add a new word to our lexicon, "**collabrency**" - A cross between collaboration and transparency. The need for a word that best describes how we should act and think about work was unmistakable. However I am not alone, English speakers are adding new ones at the rate of around 1,000 a year.

People invent new words all the time, but which ones actually make it into the dictionary? When lexicographers decide what words to add to dictionaries, they try to imagine what words people actually want to look up. There are two important factors to keep in mind here:

1) Is the word in widespread usage?

2) Does the word have staying power?

Here are some more recent additions with their official definitions. I am hoping **collabrency** will join their rank soon..

## Luckily we have a good understanding of the how we words get created and eventually added to the dictionary, All new words are created by one of following mechanisms:

[https://www.dictionary.com/e/getting-words-into-dictionaries/][1] (This link has detailed information on how a word eventually gets added to the dictionary)

**1 Derivation **The commonest method of creating a new word is to add a prefix or suffix to an existing one. Hence realization (1610s), democratise (1798), detonator (1822), preteen (1926), hyperlink (1987) and monogamish (2011).

**2 Back formation **The inverse of the above: the creation of a new root word by the removal of a phantom affix. The noun _sleaze_, for example, was back-formed from "sleazy" in about 1967\. A similar process brought about pea, liaise, enthuse, aggress and donate. Some linguists propose a separate category for lexicalization, the turning of an affix into a word (ism, ology, teen), but it's really just a type of back formation.

**3 Compounding **The juxtaposition of two existing words. Typically, compound words begin life as separate entities, then get hitched with a hyphen, and eventually become a single unit. It's mostly nouns that are formed this way (fiddlestick, claptrap, carbon dating, bailout), but words from other classes can be smooshed together too: into (preposition), nobody (pronoun), daydream (verb), awe-inspiring, environmentally friendly (adjectives).

**4 Repurposing **Taking a word from one context and applying it to another. Thus the crane, meaning lifting machine, got its name from the long-necked bird, and the computer mouse was named after the long-tailed animal.

**5 Conversion **Taking a word from one word class and transplanting it to another. The word _giant_ was for a long time just a noun, meaning a creature of enormous size, until the early 15th century, when people began using it as an adjective. Thanks to social media, a similar fate has recently befallen friend, which can now serve as a verb as well as a noun ("Why didn't you friend me?").

**6 Eponyms **Words named after a person or place. You may recognize Alzheimer's, atlas, cheddar, Alsatian, diesel, sandwich, mentor, Svengali, wellington and boycott as eponyms -- but did you know that gun, dunce, bigot, bugger, cretin, currant, hooligan, marmalade, maudlin, maverick, panic, silhouette, syphilis, tawdry, doggerel, doily and sideburns are too? (The issue of whether, and for how long, to retain the capital letters on eponyms [is a thorny one][2].)

**7 Abbreviations **An increasingly popular method. There are three main subtypes: clippings, acronyms and initialisms. Some words that you might not have known started out longer are pram (perambulator), taxi/cab (both from taximeter cabriolet), mob (mobile vulgus), goodbye (God be with you), berk (Berkshire Hunt), rifle (rifled pistol), canter (Canterbury gallop), curio (curiosity), van (caravan), sport (disport), wig (periwig), laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation), scuba (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus), and trump (triumph. Although it's worth noting that there's another, unrelated sense of trump: to fabricate, as in "trumped-up charge").

**8 Loanwords **Foreign speakers often complain that their language is being overrun with borrowings from English. But the fact is, English itself is a voracious word thief; linguist David Crystal reckons it's half-inched words from at least 350 languages. Most words are borrowed from French, Latin and Greek; some of the more exotic provenances are Flemish (hunk), Romany (cushty), Portuguese (fetish), Nahuatl (tomato -- via Spanish), Tahitian (tattoo), Russian (mammoth), Mayan (shark), Gaelic (slogan), Japanese (tycoon), West Turkic (horde), Walloon (rabbit) and Polynesian (taboo). Calques (flea market, brainwashing, loan word) are translations of borrowings.

**9 Onomatopoeia **The creation of a word by imitation of the sound it is supposed to make. Plop, ow, barf, cuckoo, bunch, bump and midge all originated this way.

**10 Reduplication **The repetition, or near-repetition, of a word or sound. To this method we owe the likes of flip-flop, goody-goody, boo-boo, helter-skelter, picnic, claptrap, hanky-panky, hurly-burly, lovey-dovey, higgledy-piggledy, tom-tom, hip hop and cray-cray. (Willy-nilly, though, came to us via a contraction of "Will he, nill he".)

**11 Nonce words **Words pulled out of thin air, bearing little relation to any existing form. Confirmed examples are few and far between, but include quark (Murray Gell-Mann), bling (unknown) and fleek (Vine celebrity Kayla Newman).

**12 Error **Misspellings, mishearing, mispronunciations and mis transcriptions rarely produce new words in their own right, but often lead to new forms in conjunction with other mechanisms. Scramble, for example, seems to have originated as a variant of scrabble; but over time, the two forms have taken on different meanings, so one word has now become two. Similarly, the words _shit_ and _science_, thanks to a long sequence of shifts and errors, are both ultimately derived from the same root. And the now defunct word helpmeet, or helpmate, is the result of a Biblical boo-boo. In the King James version, the Latin _adjutorium simile sibi_ was rendered as "an help meet for him" -- that is, "a helper suitable for him". Later editors, less familiar with the archaic sense of meet, took the phrase to be a word, and began hyphenating help-meet.

**13 Portmanteaus **Compounding with a twist. Take one word, remove an arbitrary portion of it, then put in its place either a whole word, or a similarly clipped one. Thus were born sitcom, paratroops, internet, gazunder and sexting. (Note: some linguists call this process blending and reserve the term portmanteau for a particular subtype of blend. But since Lewis Carroll, who devised this sense of portmanteau, specifically defined it as having the broader meaning, I'm going to use the terms willy-nilly.)
